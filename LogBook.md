Spring Fu does not currently support 3.0.0. As reported on issue https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-fu/issues/392, there is a chance it will not be supported at all.

Should this be the case, then that also means that Spring Fu has stopped evolving and in that case this project and the article will be changed to talk another technology that also supports declarative programming in rest services, such as Kotlin's [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).
