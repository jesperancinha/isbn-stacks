# isbn-stacks
Worldwide, the ISBN number is used. It is a massive collection of numbers which uniquely identify books per type and edition. Based on that, this project is here to evaluate the recent experimental project from the spring team called Spring-FU. As DSL that, when released, it will allow Spring applications to be developed without the use of annotations. The main argument is that annotations bring unnecessary overhead to the application and that processing time can be avoided.
